# Introduction

Plastic pollution is a major and growing problem, negatively affecting oceans and wildlife health. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) has a lot of great data at various levels including globally, per country, and over time. For this lab we focus on data from 2010.

# Learning goals

-   Visualizing numerical and categorical data and interpreting visualizations
-   Recreating visualizations
-   Getting more practice using R and RStudio

# Getting started

First, open the R Markdown document starter document,`lab-02 - lastname_firstname.Rmd`, enter your name and date in the YAML header, rename the file and Knit it. Make sure it compiles without errors. The output will be in the `.html` file with the same name, which you will submit on Canvas once you're done.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis. Run the following code to load this package.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data` folder in the files pane. Load it using the following code:

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

The dataset is now loaded as a dataframe called "plastic_waste" in your Environment pane. The dataframe contains the following variables (columns):

-   `code`: 3 Letter country code
-   `entity`: Country name
-   `continent`: Continent name
-   `year`: Year
-   `gdp_per_cap`: GDP per capita constant 2011 international \$, rate
-   `plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of plastic waste per capita in kg/day
-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of mismanaged plastic waste per capita in kg/day
-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste`: Tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste
-   `coastal_pop`: Number of individuals living on/near coast
-   `total_pop`: Total population according to Gapminder

# Warm up

-   Recall that RStudio is divided into four panes. Without looking, can you name them all and briefly describe their purpose?

-   Verify that the dataset has loaded into the Environment. How many observations are in the dataset? Clicking on the dataset in the Environment will allow you to inspect it more carefully. Alternatively, you can type `View(plastic_waste)` into the Console to do this.

-   Have a quick look at the data and notice that there are cells taking the value `NA` -- what does this mean?

**Hint:** If you're not sure, run the command `?NA` which will lead you to the documentation.

# Exercises

Let's start by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010.

::: column-margin
**Hint:** The lab instructions show you code that's not required for answering the exercises below. However, it's generally good to copy, paste and run this code yourself in your rmarkdown file. Just copy the code, create a new code block, and paste the code in that codeblock (similar to how I describe in the "How to read Moderndive" video.)
:::

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-hist, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

One country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution. One way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-max, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

Did you expect this result? You might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.

## Exercise 1

Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita [faceted](https://moderndive.com/2-viz.html#facets) by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita? Write and run the code required to create the faected histogram plot in your RMarkdown file.

::: column-margin
**NOTE:** Moving forward, the plots and the output of the code are not displayed in the lab instructions, but, as previously stated, you can and should copy the code to your R Markdown file and view the results yourself.
:::

You probably noticed that it's difficult to glean much from the visualization because Trinidad and Tobago is such an outlier. Let's remove it from the dataframe and take another look.

First, create a new data frame called `plastic_waste_no` (no for no outliers) and use the filter function to only keep observations (rows) where `entity`, the variable for country, is NOT Trinidad and Tobago. Note that the operator `!=` means "is not equal to".

```{r}
plastic_waste_no <- plastic_waste %>%
  filter(entity != "Trinidad and Tobago")
```

Copy your histogram code from the beginning of exercise 1 and paste it into a new code block. Replace plastic_waste with plastic_waste_no and run the code again.

What differences do you notice between this histogram and the first? From now on we'll use `plastic_waste_no` to generate our visualizations, mindful that we're omitting Trinidad and Tobago. If, at any point, you would like to see what the data look like with Trinidad and Tobago included, simply use `plastic_waste` instead of `plastic_waste_no`.

### Density plots

Another way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_density()
```

And compare distributions across continents by coloring density curves by continent.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let's also fill the curves in with colors as well.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what's happening with the distributions in continents plotted first, and hence covered by continents plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The `alpha` argument takes values between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.5): 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill-alpha}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

This still doesn't look great...

## Exercise 2

Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.

## Exercise 3

Why do we define the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot, but define the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom?

::: column-margin
**Hint:** you may need to go back and read about the `alpha` argument in [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/2-viz.html#overplotting) to answer this question.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-box}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Exercise 4

Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to [violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html). What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

## Exercise 5

Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita (y) and mismanaged plastic waste per capita (x) using a scatterplot. Describe the relationship.

::: column-margin
**Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots.
:::

## Exercise 6

Color the points in the scatterplot by continent. Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?

## Exercise 7

Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita (y) and total population (x) as well as plastic waste per capita (y) and coastal population (x). You will need to make two separate plots. Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?
